# flask-sample-webservicee-app-GitHub Webhook

A sample Flask application which demonstrates simple web service that listens for organization events to know when a repository has been created. From GitHub Webhook.


## Getting Started

To get started, you'll want to first clone this GitHub repository locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/niravhjoshi/GitHubHookWebApp.git
```

Next, you'll want to go into the  app directory:

```bash
$ cd GitHubHookWebApp
```

Then you'll want to install all of the Python requirements (via
[pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)):

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
or
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

And lastly, you'll want to run the `app.py` script which will spin up webserver which will start listening 5000 port and if 5000 occupied then it will pick it up another port.
the rest of the way:

```bash
$ python app.py
```
In case of if you have python3.
```bash
$ python3 app.py
```
